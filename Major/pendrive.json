Well after washing it through almost a complete cycle, cancelling the wash, and fishing it out of some sopping pants, I can say that it is waterproof. I dried it off with a towel and blew out the port, plugged it in, and it still works just as it did before. Data was still there, new data copied on, and everything was fine, and for that I give it five stars.",

                "review_text": "*Update 01-17-17* Thank you to everyone who has pointed out that the description has now actually been updated to properly describe the drive as plactic. I can assure you though that when I purchased it the description was literally identical to the metal version of this drive just with the removal of the \"high-quality meta casing\" descriptor. Which for what it's worth I didn't even notice until I went back after I had already bought and recieved the flash drive, to try and figure out where in the original description that it was described as being plastic. As far as the actual drive goes, a large peice of the casing has now broken off and I have stopped carrying it around daily. Now this drive is somewhere in my nightstand and will probably soon be replaced by something more durable. However for its flaws, it does still function, so it would probably function just fine for a more light duty role. I wouldn't expect it to survive long on a keychain though. *Update 11-9-16* Well it had a good run... of like 3 months. But now the case has actually started to break apart much as I expected it would. I have not abused this drive at all. Well at least any no more than just living on my keychain where other flash drives have survived just fine for years. Also to be clear I always removed it from said keychain before using it... I wound never expect a flash drive to support a set of keys dangling from my computer. Before I was annoyed mainly by the unclear description of the product, but at this point I would no longer recomend these blue plastic flash drives at all unless they are going to live a much more sheltered life than mine has. The only reason I am not dropping this review to one star is because so far, despite it's flaws, it does still work. **Original Review** I ordered the Regal Blue version of this flash drive because I thought the blue color looked really nice. However I was quite surprised to find out when I received it that it is actually made out of plastic. Nowhere in the description could I find any actual mention of this drive having a plastic body. The only difference in the description from the silver metal version is that they removed \"High-quality metal casing\" from the description of the regal blue version. Overall it seems like it works just fine and transfers files at a reasonable rate, but I just don't think it is going to be as durable as I had assumed it would be. The plastic seems very thin and bendy and it is already showing wear after just a single day on my key ring. I just don't see it surviving as long as my old Kingston did on my key ring. To be fair, I honestly don't have any issues with Samsung selling a plastic version of this flash drive. I just wish they would have made it more clear that's what it was, because I would have happily bought the actual metal version instead.",

This is the USB 3.0 flash drive you're looking for. There are so many different designs for flash/thumb drives out there; there's something for everyone. I wanted something that looked solid and simple, was reliable, and fast. This was it. Here's why: \u2022 The one piece body feels solid, but lightweight, and looks gorgeous \u2022 There is no cap to lose, and the USB end is sturdy enough to stand up to heavy use \u2022 The little hole can be used to attach to a key ring if necessary *** NOTE *** Please be aware that this drive is capable of USB 3.0 transfer speeds of \"up to 130MB/s\". You will only get this speed if the computer you are attaching it to also has USB 3.0, otherwise it is backwards-compatible and will reduce to USB 2.0 speeds. You can tell if it's USB 3.0 if the inside port is a blue plastic, or if the port is labelled \"SS\" (SuperSpeed). The design looks like it could've been built by aliens [see photos]. It's so simple, yet just works. It's solidly-built, with no small pieces to lose, and big and shiny enough to be visible, and is blazingly fast. Recommended.",

This will definitely saves my phone's memory storage. The copying is nice & fast. My only concern on this product is the lack of cover to protect both tips. Although the sliding mechanism in between would cover one end, the other is always left open and exposed. If they could provide a case perhaps, it would be a good protection option.

The metal design seems sturdy and should hopefully hold up to being thrown around with my keys. My only complaint would be that the drive is part metal (silver portion) and the key ring part is plastic (black/grey portion in picture). I was hoping it would be all metal but the plastic key ring seems sturdy and it should hold up over time. One other note is that the drive can get very warm when doing large transfers, it's to be expected for a small metal drive like this but it's worth mentioning.",

But for SanDisk Ultra Flair, I don't see this issue at all! Was thinking that it might be due to the 128GB but loos like it's just some thumb drive is just not that responsive. Have included a picture for relative size comparison among SiPower, Sandisk Extreme and Ultra Flair.

I was able to copy ~35GB very quickly, but then pretty much burned my fingers trying to remove it. I must grab it by the thin plastic part, not the \"easy to grab\" metal, to avoid burning.

It gets 2 stars because there's other drives just as cheap, that DO NOT slow down, and do NOT become scalding hot, like 5 mins after freshly made tea scalding. I know the drive is poorly made because when you use your fingers as a heatsink, it speeds up again to around 10 MBs, however losing 10s of MB of the speed due to poor design is simply ridiculous (from 30 to 10, or even simply 3 MB/s)",

I was a little wary of this one's plastic loop to attach it to my keyring but it's actually thick and seems strong. I was not exactly clear on how it fit on a keyring but it does! It's also actually smaller than the Silicon Power one! How do they do it??? As for speed, it is plenty fast enough on my USB 3.0 equipped laptop and I don't notice it taking any more time than my last drive did on the USB 2.0 equipped classroom computers. How's that for a completely subjective analysis? The whole reason I needed a larger drive was to carry class movies to class. It handles the large files just as well as the Silicon Power did. I've been using it for a week on a keyring with several big keys. If it fails on me, I'll be back on here to knock stars off. If you're reading it with 5 stars, it means it's still holding strong!

The culprit I'm assuming is the heat, it simply toasted itself. Like other reviewers have said, it gets extremely hot even after just a couple minutes. Imagine how long it would take and the amount of heat it would suffer writing 116 GB worth of files onto it, then reading 116 GB of files as you transfer them off. A few transfer sessions and this thing quickly burned itself out. Still, the price you pay for 128 GB of storage isn't bad, and the performance is still okay.",

At about 28 cents per gigabyte, it comes out to be cheaper than the 32GB (31 cents per gigabyte) and the 8GB (52 cents per gigabyte) of the same brand. Shipping: **** 4 Stars for shipping. I had to have all my products grouped together when purchasing, so I spent a week waiting. After it shipped, though, it came very quickly. Product: ***** 5 Stars for the product. It works as expected, although there are some extra features and some issues that I have had. The extra features include the SanDisk Secure Access Vault, which allows you to password protect specific files. I did not know that that was a feature, but it's good to know that my files can be secured. However, the Secure Access Vault did not allow me to update it on my Windows computer. That was not a problem for me, but if you have a mac that is running the latest version, you may run into trouble. The drive feels very cheap, and is made almost completely from plastic. It obviously will not withstand too much rough use, so be careful not to drop it or apply too much pressure to it. The item is made in China, as shown on the product. Also, the actual storage capacity if 14.5 GB, not 16 exactly, so be careful if you need that amount of space. For the price, you really can't beat this product. It is small, compact, and opens extremely fast on my computer. I just unplugged it and replugged it in and the folder opened almost immediately. It also features a small hole near the top that can be used to attach it to a lanyard or keychain.

Not only did it fail me, but it failed on my FIRST attempt of use! :( I transferred 78GB file (Photo library - 1 file - Mac). Albeit, it took almost 7 hours to transfer, it did end up fully transferring). I then went on to transfer enough (additional) files to fill up 94-95% of it's registered capacity per my computer's displayed capacity of 124.22GB. I do this with all new storage drives I purchase - I fill them up almost to 100%, then transfer the files to another external storage system I have and check the integrity of the files sent from the new device to my ultimate backup device. If they made the transfer successfully on and off the new drive, I then precede to use it for whatever my heart desires. Like other reviewers on here, it got extremely hot and ended up slowing down quite a bit (seemingly after seconds of initiating the copy/paste transfer). Unfortunately, the drive ended up becoming corrupt and now I can't remove the files from my trashcan. I've tried \"Verifying\" and \"Repairing\" the disk via \"Disk Utility\" on my MacBook air, as well as a secondary Apple Desktop. I've also attempted to remove it through the \"Terminal\" via Apple's latest OS system. Additionally, I've taken it to the local Apple store in-person to see if there was something else I wasn't trying... It's completely unusable now and what's also unfortunate is I just recently found the time to start working with it since purchased (Nov. 28th of last year) = past the 30 day return policy. Not only am I out the money I spent on this item, but I'm also out a number of hours (6+) of my time from attempting to resolve the issue. Huge disappointment. Seems as though SanDisk had a huge design flaw with this specific model (makes sense, considering the advertised capacity versus the physical dimensions). Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your external digital storage needs.",

I tried many things but the flash drive simply would not show up. I plugged it into a USB 3 port on my Windows PC, and it wouldn't show up there either. My Windows PC also has some USB 2 ports and I tried plugging it in there. It DID show up! I connected a USB 2 hub to the USB 3 hub on the new iMac and plugged the flash drive into the USB 2 hub. Guess what... it DID show up. So after the first usage, this device does not work on any USB 3 port. This is strange, because USB 3 ports are supposedly downward compatible with USB 2 devices. Also, the USB 3 hub had no problem working with the USB 2 hub. The really disappointing aspect of this is that I'm told \"This item is not eligible for return\". I've been had!",

Unfortunately, this one had no reviews, but was such a good deal, I decided to purchase it anyway. I have read about fake usb flash devices being sold (mainly on ebay but also on amazon), so I was a bit wary. Happily, this device is as advertised: I ran a full f3 test (this is the linux equivalent to h2testw) to determine the true capacity - it really is 64 GB and operates at USB 2.0 speeds (ubuntu disk utility benchmark reports average read rate of 35.8 MB/s and write rate of 3.0 MB/s). Pros: - good price (approx $1 per GB) - full 64 GB of storage in very small package - trusted SanDisk name - validates as true 64GB USB 2.0 device - small metal rod on back for connecting to key chain - BoBoTech shipped quickly Cons: - USB 2 is a bit slow (but USB3 devices are WAY more expensive) - plastic shell seems a bit flimsy (this hasn't been a problem on my smaller 16GB Cruzer) - 1/8\" wider on each side from the connector - very tight fit next to power connector on my laptop Overall, I would recommend this drive if you are looking for a large capacity thumb drive and can live with USB 2 transfer speeds.",

                "review_text": "I am a SanDisk fan. I have always used there products and have been happy with the speed and reliability that they offered. Recently I upgraded from the SanDisk Cruzer 16GB to the 32GB. Right away I noticed it was taking longer to move files. Also from time to time it would just stop during transfer. I left it on all night thinking it would finish and it never did. I Decommissioned that one and bought another a few months later locally this time. I figured I must have gotten a hold of a bad one. The new 32GB Cruzer did the same thing. I just worked around the issues and continued using it. I figured the 32gb model must be flawed in some way. Still being a fan of SanDisk Cruzers I just recently upgraded to the 64GB model. So far it hasn't stopped during transfer but it still seemed to be taking to long. I decided to try a little test. I Purchased a Transcend 64GB thumb drive. I made a folder on my desktop and put 70 files of varying sizes equaling 4.03GB. I copied the folder to my SanDisk and timed it then I did the same with the Transcend. Here are the results: SanDisk Cruzer 64GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ36-064G-B35 transferring 70 files equaling 4.03GB it took 18.34 minutes Transcend 64 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive - TS64GJF500E transferring the same took 13.43 minutes I can't speak for the long term reliability of the Transcend thumb because this is the first I've owned. What I do know is that it has a good solid feel, it's cheaper then the SanDisk of the same size, and it's considerably faster. I'm going to continue testing this drive and if it works out and I grow to trust it I will post again and let everyone know. For now I'm going to lean toward Transcend. ** Update as of 01/30/2013 ** I continued using both the Sandisk 64 and the Transcend 64 daily at work. The Sandisk is still significantly slower and occasionally stops responding during transfer. Unfortunately there is no safe way to remove it because technically it's still in use and will not respond to safe ejection procedures both in Windows and Linux. I just do a system shutdown hopping the OS will safely close the open files. I then remove it, restart the machine and try again. This may sound a bit extreme but I do it for a reason. One time it stopped responding on a 3 gig transfer so I let it sit for an hour. When I came back it was still unresponsive so I removed it and took it to another machine I was updating. When I inserted it the new machine I was asked if I wanted to format the Sandisk. I lost everything. Fortunately I had the same data on the transcend so it was just an inconvenience. If however I had been relying solely on the SanDisk it would have been a very long night. The Transcend 64 still continues to surprise me with it's reliability and speed. It is used at work in the daily grind and shows no signs of instability or speed loss. Seven month tested daily, head to head- Transcend 64 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive TS64GJF500E VS SanDisk Cruzer 64GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ36-064G-B35. And!... It's Transcend for the Win! Sorry SanDisk, this was a complete miss match. With all your resources, funding, and experience You should have stomped transcend into the ground. You need to get your staff into one room and discuss who dropped the ball and what your going to do about it. Your pro's, this should never have happened and because it did you've introduced doubt into the minds of consumers you had won over years ago. This leaves me wondering was it a shameful loss for SanDisk or is there a new player in the game. In my opinion Transcend just stepped out of the background and into the foreground. They will be given serious consideration during my purchases in the future.",

SanDisk is a trusted brand, so I was excited to find such a deal on this 32GB disk. I found the disk to perform as expected. It hold loads of pictures, creating an easy way for me to organize my photos from the last few years. I did notice the more photos I added to the disk, the slower it got, not a pace that was inconvenient, just one that took a little more time to get loaded up with photos. In terms of the design of the disk itself, the sleek black look is nice. It has a small metal bar on the back that could be used to attach to a key chain or something similar. The red button is fairly easy to push open and close, but not so easy that it will accidentally open when in a bag or purse. Once the drive is extended, it is easily inserted into a computer without the drive pushing back into the case (a problem I have had with other disks). Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a drive to save photos or other things on. I will purchase another when this one is all full.",

PNY is one of the only two I trust over and over again. They never fall apart or break, unlike many that have fallen apart and can't be read. PNY also never gets stuck in the drive and falls apart trying to get them out. They are very solidly made and hold up well. I still have one of the first PNY flash drives I purchased. (and I won't tell you how many years ago, because that would give away my age) They are solidly made with a cap that never gets loose or falls off. They go into the USB drive easily and are removed with the same ease. I enjoy all the sizes of storage and use the higher ones for large storage like backups and music. I use other sizes for files I want to store but don't need them currently taking up room on my computer. I use others for work on computers that I do not want to leave any information or files on, I insert the USB flash drive, run a program - save it to the same flash drive and detach. Nothing left behind. Others I use for sharing and swapping. I often share family pictures with others so I will give them the drive, they use or download the family pictures and sometimes send other pictures they have back to me. So you can see I use a lot of drives. I have a few spare for other things that pop up but must have 75-100 at least. Since my data is critical to me and I don't need to lose what is on my flash drive, I trust PNY to always be there. It has been at least 10 years since I have lost any data so that says something for the quality of their items.",

For me, going into computer science, and having to save long programs, I had to order another drive right away in case something happened. I went with the other highly rater SanDisk, which is great and shows up right away on my computer. I'll use the PNY as back up. I only had four class meetings too!

This one takes about 10 seconds, then windows shows a dialog about installing it, and 20-30 seconds after it is plugged in you can use it. Not a huge deal, but it means that my 64GB is still my 'daily driver' with the 128GB being used for large files that are not used frequently.

I don't know if it was a bad batch or lack of quality control. I ordered two of the 16GB models. I'm an IT consultant and I buy a LOT of inexpensive (< $10) 16 - 32GB flash drives to use for client backups and for making Recovery Drives on new Windows installs. I buy drives made by Lexar, PNY and Kingston all the time. I'm not expecting a high-end product, since these are budget prices, but I expect the drive to at least work reliably. There was something very wrong with these two drives I received. Right off the bat, they took up to a minute to be recognized by Windows - not just the first time, which is understandable, but EVERYTIME. This indicates to me that that Windows is having trouble querying the drive, which means that the drive's firmware is defective, or it's slow to respond due to inferior quality or defective NAND memory chips or controller logic. On top of that, when I benchmarked these drives using HDTach they ran at a miserable 12 MB/s on the quick read test. Cheap, budget 16GB flash drives I've bought many times previously can usually reach at least 20 MB/s, again indicating inferior quality. For $5.99 I nearly just threw them in the trash, assuming I'd have to pay shipping, but ultimately I decided to apply for a return and refund. I was happy to find out that the return process on Amazon is simple (despite buying from Amazon for years, I've never had to return anything before) AND they pay for return shipping (you can print a pre-paid UPS label).",

The metal casing feels strong yet light. And it fits easily on any keychain. It's about 80% the size of a standard house key (see my photo that I added). Also, it's very good looking. Looks great on the keychain; looks great when inserted into any computer. The drive read/write speeds are a little on the slow side but reasonable. I timed some file transfers on my computer (Dell Optiplex 380): * For read speeds, I averaged 16.1 MB/s (ranged from 10 MB/s to 18 MB/s). * For write speeds, I averaged 6.8 MB/s (ranged from 4 MB/s to 11 MB/s). In general, larger files took longer to transfer than smaller files (single 300 MB file took longer to move than one hundred 3 MB files). Other users with the same device have reported an average of 17-18 MB/s read speeds and 11-12 MB/s write speeds. These are considered to be AVERAGE speeds for usb flash drives. If speed is of the essence, then look for a high speed drive that can read/write 30 MB/s or faster. If you're mostly transferring documents, photos, and other small files, then these speeds should suffice. Another small complaint. I do not feel a 'click' when the drive is inserted fully. So I just push until it won't go in anymore or when I see that the computer has recognized the drive. A minor annoyance in an otherwise great USB drive. I highly recommend this drive. While the speed on this device is not top notch, its performance is reliable and it comes in a great little package.",

Pros - Small. 39mm x 12.2mm x 4.5mm There are some flash drives that are a bit thinner at about 2.5mm, but you loose the advantage of having protected contacts. - Tough all metal case. It could survive a lot more abuse than competing flash drives that are plastic. I have no concerns with leaving it on a keychain that gets tossed around. - large strong metal loop for keychain or lanyard, inner diameter 8.4mm - Decent speed, but not blazing fast: Large file writes 8MB/s, reads 17MB/s - Cost was very competitive compared to all other 16GB drives, and less than others in this small size class. - 5 year warranty Cons - open end is susceptible to dust or lint accumulation, it may need to be blown out periodically with compressed air. This is the tradeoff versus having a cap that may get lost. - Does not fit into some machines. The mechanical tolerances are such that it will not plug into some machines without using so much force that you risk damaging the port on the computer. I've never experienced this problem with any other USB drive I've owned, and I have at least 10 different models including others from Kingston. There isn't any excuse for this and it's the reason I took off two stars - I can't use it in all \"Universal\" Serial Bus ports. Possibly with more insertion/removal cycles it will loosen up, but it should work fine right out of the box. Bottom Line - if it fits the computers you need to use it with and high speed isn't a concern, it's a great little flash drive at a good price. But, if you need a drive that must work in any random computer you encounter such as at the library, this may not be the best choice.",

                "review_text": "I needed a USB drive on my keychain. I bought 6 different ones (some purchased at Amazon and some at Staples). This one is my favorite. The metal casing feels strong yet light. And it fits easily on any keychain. It's about 80% the size of a standard house key (see my photo that I added). Also, it's very good looking. Looks great on the keychain; looks great when inserted into any computer. The drive read/write speeds are a little on the slow side but reasonable. I timed some file transfers on my computer (Dell Optiplex 380): * For read speeds, I averaged 16.1 MB/s (ranged from 10 MB/s to 18 MB/s). * For write speeds, I averaged 6.8 MB/s (ranged from 4 MB/s to 11 MB/s). In general, larger files took longer to transfer than smaller files (single 300 MB file took longer to move than one hundred 3 MB files). Other users with the same device have reported an average of 17-18 MB/s read speeds and 11-12 MB/s write speeds. These are considered to be AVERAGE speeds for usb flash drives. If speed is of the essence, then look for a high speed drive that can read/write 30 MB/s or faster. If you're mostly transferring documents, photos, and other small files, then these speeds should suffice. Another small complaint. I do not feel a 'click' when the drive is inserted fully. So I just push until it won't go in anymore or when I see that the computer has recognized the drive. A minor annoyance in an otherwise great USB drive. I highly recommend this drive. While the speed on this device is not top notch, its performance is reliable and it comes in a great little package.",

Pros - Small. 39mm x 12.2mm x 4.5mm There are some flash drives that are a bit thinner at about 2.5mm, but you loose the advantage of having protected contacts. - Tough all metal case. It could survive a lot more abuse than competing flash drives that are plastic. I have no concerns with leaving it on a keychain that gets tossed around. - large strong metal loop for keychain or lanyard, inner diameter 8.4mm - Decent speed, but not blazing fast: Large file writes 8MB/s, reads 17MB/s - Cost was very competitive compared to all other 16GB drives, and less than others in this small size class. - 5 year warranty Cons - open end is susceptible to dust or lint accumulation, it may need to be blown out periodically with compressed air. This is the tradeoff versus having a cap that may get lost. - Does not fit into some machines.
