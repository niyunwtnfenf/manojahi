                "review_text": "The SanDisk Ultra 80MB/s is a new card that replaces the Ultra 40MB/s. The 80MB/s is the read speed only. SanDisk refers to the write speed as Class 10, which means the card maintains at least 10MB/s continuous write, but does not state a maximum write speed. I tested the following Ultra 80MB/s cards: (2) 32GB, 64GB and 128GB and compare with the previous Ultra 40MB/s cards. I use CrystalDiskMark benchmark (5 passes, 1GB random data) and USB 3.0 card reader. SanDisk Ultra 80MB/s (new version, September 2015) 32GB (1) Read: 94.2 MB/s Write: 43.0 MB/s 32GB (2) Read: 97.7 MB/s Write: 20.9 MB/s 64GB Read: 82.4 MB/s Write: 19.1 MB/s 128GB Read: 97.7 MB/s Write: 38.5 MB/s SanDisk Ultra 40MB/s (old version, 2014-2015) 32GB Read: 47.8 MB/s Write: 19.9 MB/s 64GB Read: 47.8 MB/s Write: 16.2 MB/s READ Speed: Ultra 80MB/s cards exceed 80MB/s read speed and are much faster than the old version. This allows fast downloads from the card to your computer when used with a USB 3.0 card reader. Using USB 2.0 it limits the speed to about 35MB/s. WRITE Speed: Benchmarks can be deceiving! The benchmarks show a big difference in write speed between cards. One 32GB card measured 43MB/s but one from a different source was 20.9MB/s. When writing actual files the write speed varies during transfer. The 128GB card benchmark was 38.5MB/s write, but transferring a large file I see a range between 16-24MB/s throughout the transfer. Only the faster 32GB card was able to maintain above 40MB/s write speed for the duration. There was also a big difference in 512K random write performance between cards (~1MB/s vs 20-24MB/s). Write speed of 15-20MB/s seems to be typical of Ultra cards. They are good for general photography, but not fast enough for extended continuous shooting. Once you hit the buffer limit in the camera it can become very sluggish if the write speed is not high enough. If you only take one shot at a time the write speed speed should be sufficient. I am tempted to remove a star because of the variance between cards, but all cards exceeded their speed ratings. The improved READ speed over the previous version is a benefit. Actual write speed may not be much better than the older cards. You might get an extra fast sample, but do not buy this card expecting outstanding write performance!",

And, despite having used a few dozen of them over the years, some of which have been filled/downloaded/erased 100+ times, I've never had a single failure or corrupted file. And that's in sharp contrast to having had many failures from lesser cards that have had much less use. During a vacation in Bryce Canyon, for example, I filled my SanDisk card while out for the day and switched to a backup Transcend card. Everything seemed fine taking pictures and videos with the Transcend until back at the hotel room it turned out to be unreadable in my laptop. Even trying various \"recovery\" programs yielded nothing usable. It had failed and took a bunch of vacation pics and video with it. So, lesson learned, don't try to save money on SD cards unless it's for a non-critical application where you don't care if you lose whatever's on it. That said, the SanDisk Ultra cards are a significant step below the SanDisk Extreme Pro cards in terms of write performance. The published specs are misleading implying the 80 MB/s Ultra is nearly as fast as the 95 MB/s Pro. But the write speeds to the Pro are typically at least twice as fast. If your application is mainly reading the card the Ultra is a good value. If you plan to write large amounts of data and don't want to wait, or shoot high frame-rate raw stills, or high bit rate HD or 4K video, get the Extreme Pro if you can afford it.",

I think I may share something that a lot of people may not be aware of, since I have informed many family and friends and they said they we unaware and glad I had told them. When shopping for this type of memory card, there are a couple of things on the card to look for. The obvious one being the size of the card, this one being 32gb for instance. It's also extremely useful to know that the very small number with a circle around it is of importance too. This one has a 10 with a circle around it. These cards will have 1-10 on it. The significance is Minimum Serial Data Writing Speed,meaning Class 10 cards have a minimum transfer rate of 10 MB/s. Your card may also display a U with either a I or II in it, signifying the ultra high speed bus (UHS). Now apply this to what you're using this particular card for. I bought it for my trail camera. A class 10 card is used for full HD (1080p) video recording and consecutive recording of HD stills. UHS Class 1 cards are used for real-time broadcasts and recording large HD video files. Other cards would have worked for my trail cam but this one was ideal, and affordable.",

                "review_text": "The quality of this card is relative to how you plan on using it. I bought it last year to use in my point and shoot digital camera (12MP) while on vacation and it worked perfectly. No, a year later, I've bought a DSLR and found it just wasn't up to snuff. My DSLR (26MP) creates files of too large a size for this card to quickly save. Want to take one picture? Fine, but be prepared to wait 20+ seconds for it to be fully saved onto the card, during which time you will be unable to take any other photos. Want to shoot in burst mode? Forget about it; it's not going to work. What I had been unaware of when I first bought this card is that memory cards have speed ratings which indicate how quickly they can process the data you want to write on them. To further complicate things, there are two types of ratings, Speed Class and Ultra High Speed. Speed classes come in four ratings, C2, C4, C6, and C10, which means they can write data at a rate of 2MB/s, 4MB/s, 6MB/s, and 10MB/s, respectively, or UHS comes in UHS U1 and U3, which writes at speeds of 10MB/s and 30MB/s. The higher the MB/s, the better the card. This card writes at a C4 speed (as indicated by the number 4 encircled by a C on the label). It's a decent speed for smaller files, but considering a RAW photo files can be rather large, if you're shooting high res, RAW files, this is not the card for you. It will absolutely freeze up your camera. If you are interested in an SD card for a DSLR, look at something like the Lexar Professional 600x 32GB SDHC UHS-I Flash Memory Card LSD32GCRBNA600 . Since switching to the C10/U1 Lexar, I've been infinitely more happy with my camera. The Sandisk C4 32GB remains in my point and shoot, where it's better suited.",

I had received one with a little no frills digital camera a few years ago & had used them already but a recent faux pas brought my ignorance to light. I was at one of my daughter's competitions with my little Panasonic video camera intending to record her show (she does color guard). We had bought the video camera a couple of years ago. It needed a memory card so I just took the one out of my other camera thinking that's what I needed. Here's where not realizing the difference between MB and GB ruined my plans.Trying to record the show, I kept getting the message that the memory was full. Turns out... The card was just 512MB! Those of you in the know are laughing I'm sure...yep, that may be fine for photos but NOT video..So after finding out 1 GB is roughly the same as 1000 MB, I knew what to look for. This card has a good amount of memory. I've recorded several of my daughter's routines and still show as having just under half the memory available. I also have found that you get what you pay for. I bought a generic card that didn't work and another that got corrupted quickly so I only trust SanDisk now! My next step is getting a 32GB and having a backup card at all times!",

Take the time to assure BEFORE you Click \"Add to Cart\" that your source is \"SOLD BY SANDISK, FULFILLED BY AMAZON.\" BUY FROM OTHER SOURCES AND YOU MAY GET BURNED* I have four uses for a card like this: 1) Storage for an HP Photo Frame 2) Storage in a Nikon D40 DSLR 3) Storage in a Panasonic Video Camera which shoots H.264 video and writes to a mini-DVD or an SD-Card. 4) Moving images between devices. I want to get this review published ASAP to save others looking for SD and SDHC cards some time. So, I am going to focus on #2 above and edit the review for points 1,3, and 4 above after I use the card in the other devices. This card arrived quickly (Fulfillment by Amazon, sold by SanDisk + Prime Membership)! I ordered two of them, because ordering individual cards was a little less expensive than ordering them in pairs or quads (go figure???). *The reason I wanted to get this review quickly published is because I wanted to help stop others from WASTING HOURS reading negative reviews about cards sold by other vendors that were maybe knock-offs, not the same as the picture, SDHC cards substituted for SD cards, etc. Simply look for \"Sold by SanDisk\" \"Fulfilled by Amazon\" in the product description BEFORE clicking \"Add to Cart.\" Hope in the future that Amazon punishes vendors who ship inferior, counterfeit, or products different than described or pictured. Right now, the only way I see to determine if this might be the case is to S L O W L Y read the 1 and 2 Star reviews for a product. Four or maybe even two years ago, you could comfortably make a purchase based on 4-Stars or above. No more - especially on these commodity products where confusion exists regarding product specifications. [On this product alone: SD vs. SDXC vs. SDHC; Suitability of Capacity; Choice of writing speed for application. For in-depth information see SDCard dot ORG] An overall rating is NO LONGER a sufficient criterion for a purchasing decision since many of these commodity type products have their reviews gamed by paid reviewers. Anyway - just as I was about to order this same card bundled in a two pack, I saw the link for \"38 sellers offer this product\" and clicked the link. Huzzah - here was the same card, less expensive, and SOLD from the MANUFACTURER, SanDisk! The worries about getting a product other than described or represented was eliminated! This product was coming directly from SanDisk and was fulfilled by Amazon. Shipment was quick, and frustration free packaging meant the product was in my hand about 30 seconds after I retrieved that package. 2) I put it in the camera, and the Nikon D40 immediately formatted the card and it was ready for use. The information screen said that it was ready to hold 2.2K (2200) pictures. I held down the shutter in continuous mode, and fired off about 20 seconds of pictures (the D40 shoots somewhere around 3 or 3.3 pics per second in burst mode). There was no stutter, lag, etc. when writing to the card. This SDHC card (remember different format than SD, which was the format available when I bought the camera) worked flawlessly in this little test. I buy only SanDisk or Lexar products, and I can say that media from neither company has ever let me down. The two Lexar cards have stored downloaded and erased around 72K pictures over six years, generally at 300-500 pics per download/erase/format cycle and are still going strong with the original capacity intact. The warranty information enclosed with this SanDisk SDHC product indicates a 5 year warranty in the United States. Warranty periods may be different in other countries. These cards are each pre-packed in a certified Frustration Free Packaging (FFP) mailer labelled Amazon/SanDisk (No. 80-56-10641), and then shipped in a bubble wrap envelope which was 11.25\" x 9\". The bubble envelope seemed too big, but perhaps that size was necessary to accommodate the huge shipping label. I will post some pictures of the package and card. There is NO Cardholder Plastic Case, so you will need to supply your own keeper. --------------------------------EDIT UPDATE for Points 1 & 4 Above 11/14/2013-------------------------------- 1) The card worked flawlessly in a Hewlett-Packard Digital Frame (both versions DF1010v1 and DF1010p1). Hewlett Packard - HP DF1010P1 10.1in LCD Digital Photo Frame, 16:10 Aspect Ratio, 800x480 Resolution, Clock, Calendar Display, Dark Espresso Wood 4) Write speed is very quick from PC to this card. Bursts of over 30 MB/s with an average around 10-15 MB/s. Faster than the Cruzer Flash Drives SanDisk Cruzer Fit 16 GB x2 = 32GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ33-016G-B35-2PK w/ Everything But Stromboli (TM) Lanyard I reviewed elsewhere, but the utility of this SDHC card for moving files is limited by equipment that does not have a built-in card reader. 3) Will update for Panasonic CamCorder soon.",

I did some research online and found a reference where some where having the same issue and others were not. I decided to go to a local store and I found the exact same PNY SD card. I purchased it and tried it at home. Well guess what? It worked! Not errors. I looked at both packages in great detail and only found a few differences. Note the pictures: The SD card on the right DOES work as a UHS-I U3 @ 100mbs the one on the left I purchased from amazon and is NOT recognized as a UHS-I U3.

This one is slightly faster and was cheapest of all. Some people report problems with PNY but, I have never had any. I think the people with the problems are handling the cards all wrong on insertion or in general or, more likely, they got fake cards. I teach a basic digital photo class at a university and, I see the most incredible things with cards. One student came in with his split in half! It was a cheap, old, small card but still, how does that even happen? You have to be handling it really badly. Not storing it safely when out of camera (get a card case!) Amazon does not seem to sell the fake ones and mine have been great and have all the same pro capabilities as Lexar and San Disk. Waterproof, shock proof, etc. Not that I let it get to that, ever! The other thing people do not do is to reformat the cards IN the camera they are using them in. If you just stick a card in, it will work. But reformating it in camera (see your menus) ensures it is set up for that camera OS. Do that when you get a new card and before you shoot on it.",

That said I paid 22.99 USD for 64GB's which is a pretty good deal, I probably have a million Sandisk cards but I was hoping PNY could compare. I will try the card in other devices but I did extensive continuous shooting with the a6300's 11fps+ continuous 24MP sensor and the buffer clear a lot slower than cards that were Class 10 but not UHS-I by a slight amount and Sony's UHS-I seemed to be superior with Sandisk Extreme Pro maintaining its deserved status as king. If you just need 64GB's for everything up to 1080p60 at 50-60Mbps and this card is cheaper than Sandisk, Sony, or Lexar then you are absolutely fine, most of you will be shooting AVCHD at 24-28Mbps anyways but if you need true UHS-I or near UHS-II performance look elsewhere.",

However, just days after the return policy expired, the card started intermittently failing to receive data at the required data rate. The U3 speed is a hard requirement of the 4K shooting on this camera with its huge MJPEG files, so if you are buying this \"U3\"-rated card for that purpose, beware that you will find the camera halting during 4K recording sessions with this card due to depleted buffer, presumably as a result of the card performing slower than what is required. I sent the card in to PNY since it does have a lifetime warranty, and they did send me a replacement, but I have reproduced the problem with the replacement. Therefore, I can only assume that the entire product line is below the U3 standard and you're being fleeced by PNY with a false speed rating.",

I use this in a digital camera where it's kind of important to me to be sure I don't lose pictures. Did not disappoint, even with burst mode. PNY has been a reliable brand for me over the years, both with memory cards and flash drives, and this card just solidified my opinion of them even more. As a side note, I do think it's probably more expensive than it needs to be, but the old adage of getting what you pay for comes into play more often than not with memory cards and flash drives, so I was willing to pay a little more to be sure I got what I needed with no surprises.",

With v30 or higher you get best FULL HD quality video and great 4K. This card is BEST for HD video and fast motion picture taking (sports) because of fast writing speed.

I happen to get a fake rebranded card and it was not easy to tell. I contacted sandisk and they verified by the serials and images that it was indeed a fake card. More so I did a test on the card to see if it was a small 4-8gb card or even a real 64. Its a real 64gb card but some cheap china one I assume. You cant always tell by the cards because sometimes they look pretty good. There were a few things that threw me off. 1. the yellow lock switch 2.the serials and images on the back of the card 3. The super gold plates 4. The plastic (real ones will look different) 5. The sticker on the front (off center and not perfect) 6. Speed testing. 7. Gut instincts (varies based on size of gut and experience) I did a heavy load on the card with 50gb of wedding images and it handled it. Next I did a Black magic speed test and ill post the numbers below. I contacted amazon and they have allowed the refund to be made. I cant risk having a low performance card for weddings especially for the price. If you can please double check your cards by verifying it through Sandisk services. All you have to do is email them with the serials on the card. Super easy and they respond within a day. I gave it two stars because amazon service is amazing. I also have some images of a fake and a real card. Hope this helps",

                "review_text": "I have reached advertised speeds on a built-in card reader and a newer digital camera but there are a few things anyone should know when choosing a card. Cards with 32GB or less are SDHC and should work with most devices released in the last few years. SDXC will cover cards with higher capacities, such as this card in 64GB. This is an important consideration to Linux users since SDXC uses exFAT which may not work with your OS. If you have an up-to-date Windows installation or a recent Mac release you will be fine without third party software, though a firmware update may be necessary for your card reader if it's pre-'09. You will not achieve UHF speeds on a USB 2.0 bus - you will see a maximum 20-30MB/S depending on file size and other factors. On many host devices the speed gains are negligible during operation because of fast internal memory buffers - I can burst (9/s) an average of 15 shots in RAW+jpeg on my DSLR with a class 6 card, or 18 with this - so probably not worth the premium price for that gain alone. Video there is no difference since the class 6 can float the 20mbps required for 1080i on my camera. In other words, if you can get the extreme pro in 64GB for the same price as the extreme in 128GB, your money is probably better spent on the extreme, if not on a non-UHF card, which is to say class 6 or 10. It may be noteworthy that this card is waterproof and x-ray proof, but does not specify that it is magnet proof as other brands' documentation does. That said, Sandisk has some of the most robust built-in error checking features in the 'biz and other brands don't really compete in quality if you do some research. My advice is to make sure you can use the extra speed you're paying for - if you don't have a USB 3.0 card reader, a host device with USB 3.0 PC connection, or a built-in card reader on a laptop that's either newer or has a recent firmware update, you may be wasting a fair sum of money here. Also make sure your device says SDXC if you do go above 32GB. Many devices' documentation will explicitly say that it works up to 32GB. It'll just try to format the card over and over if you feed it an SDXC. Hopefully some info here was helpful! Happy hunting",

I ran a speed test and on the card that was rated for up to 35MB/s it maxed out at 10MB/s read and write so I contacted Amazon and they made it right. That made me curious about this card that I had already had for over a year. So I tested it and being rated for 95MB/s I get 17.2 MB/s write and 19.2MB/s read. Edit: SanDisk again confirms that my Extreme Pro card is genuine & tell me the slow read/write speeds are due to my card reader. I still advise you to avoid frustration free packaging as the SanDisk Ultra card I received was a counterfeit. Again, thanks to Amazon for allowing me to return it outside the standard time frame.",

                "review_text": "GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SANDISK CARDS SanDisk sells cards in various classes. Basically, the higher the class of card, the faster the SD card saves the file (anywhere from 20 MB/second to 95 MB/second). This is important if you want to take advantage of advanced camera functions such as fast action shots, continuous burst mode and multiple frames per second, and HD video (1080p). Photos are written to your card almost instantly at the higher classes so you'll get your best shot, and you\u2019ll save time moving it all from your camera to your computer. If you use these camera functions with a lower class SD card, you may lose data and experience dropouts and stuttering. ABOUT THIS SANDISK CLASS 4 SD CARDS This is a standard Class 4 SD card with write speeds of 20 MB/second. Unless you take advantage of high end camera functions, you won't need a higher class (i.e. more expensive) card. I have used these cards in point and shoot cameras and game/trail cameras for the better part of a decade. I have also used some other brands. However, I've never had a SanDisk card malfunction like the other cards I've used despite operating in below 0 degree to over 100 degrees conditions (rated to operate in conditions between -13 and 185 degrees) and running them through the washer/dryer. These standard Class 4 cards are completely compatible with cameras, laptops, tablets, and other devices that support the SDHC and SDXC formats, and are capable of recording hours of HD video (720p). These cards vary in their storage capacity (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 GB). CONCLUSION The best thing about these cards is that they come with a 5-year warranty. However, I doubt that you'd ever use it. If you want quality, you can't go wrong with these SanDisk cards. I hope my review helps!",

                "review_text": "When I first tested this product ( Transcend Information 32 GB High Speed 10 UHS Flash Memory Card TS32GSDU1 ) around end of last year, I was quite happy with the results. According to CrystalDiskMark v3.01, the card delivered a Sequential Read speed of 20MB/s and Write speed of 19MB/s. This means it far exceeded the minimum speed requirement for a 'class-10' card, which is just 10MB/s in Write. On the other hand, those number are no where close to the '300x' printed on the card, which implies 45MB/s. I suspect that the card reader I used ( Transcend M5 ) was limiting the speed of this card. So recently I re-tested this card using the Transcend USB 3.0 Card Reader (TS-RDF5K) . I was delighted to see dramatic increases in both Read and Write speeds: - Sequential Read speed increased from 20.0MB/s to 34.8MB/s (+74%) - Sequential Write speed increased from 19.0MB/s to 29.0MB/s (+53%) One important point to note: I did my benchmark with the RDF5 card reader plugged in to an USB 2.0 port. The theoretical speed limit for USB 2.0 port is 60MB/s, but in practice the most you can get is around 60%, or 36MB/s. So the maximum speed of my Transcend card is still being limited by the USB 2.0 port. I expect both the Read and Write speeds to be even higher if I can conduct my benchmark from an USB 3.0 port. Just for comparison: - My old Transcend TS16GSDHC10E says 'class-10' but not 'UHS'. It delivers 21.7MB/s in Read and 16.8MB/s in Write, under identical test conditions. - The SanDisk Ultra SDSDU-032G-U46 claims both 'UHS' and 'class-10'. Its Read speed maxed-out at 38.8MB/s, but its Write speed pales at just 12.7MB/s. (See the benchmark results of several SDHC cards I uploaded to 'Customer Images' section) Conclusion: This Transcend UHS card is one of my fastest SDHC cards, together with the HP CG790A-AZ Class 10 SDHC . The two cards are neck-and-neck in terms of Read/Write speeds. But currently the Transcend card is cheaper, which makes it a better value. By the way, I have used at least one dozen Transcend memory cards (including CF, SD and micro-SD) over the past decade, and have never encountered any card failures. So I have no questions about the reliability of Transcend products.",

After reading many different reviews on different memory cards, I learned that it was the memory card not my camera that caused the problem. Strangely, Sandisk class 6 memory card caused no problem. But as I have only one 8 GB class6 card, I decided to try this Transcend card. It was delivered early enough and I formatted it and started shooting video several times. It continued shooting without stopping for a little over 12 minutes, which I believe is the time limit of my camera, not the memory card.

Yes, no DELAY. I was so impressed, I put it into my EOS 60D. In this camera, I never noticed any writing speeds change, but I didn't have any problems with my old SD cards either. The next HUGE change in speed I noticed was when I plugged the new card into my computer. I transferred about 30 full resolution images from the new card in about four seconds. Not hyper speed by any measure but, with my old cards, this would have easily been 10 or more seconds. So, the speed claim is exactly on spot with me.

I wont risk missing a shot or even worse getting the perfect shot and then having the Flash Memory not work. I have been using Transcend 64GB Flash Memory for over a year now. I will not shoot with anything but this Flash Memory. My time and my profits are too valuable to risk with anything but the finest. rechargeable. I am more than happy to use as well as recommend this product to anyone who needs the highest value equipment.",

I use larger 64GB Transcend 60MB/s 400x card for regular recording use, just to double the overall time period for recordings. Transcend is reliable, in wide temperature conditions, and that's critical for a car security camera (such as the Street Guardian).",
