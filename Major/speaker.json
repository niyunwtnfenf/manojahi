I have used this in my basement (30'x30') and it sounds hellagood, as well as in a moving truck with loud road noise as a handsfree device while driving. It doesn't require a password to bind, but instead binds to the last thing it was paired with if available, or whatever is asking to pair. I have paired it with win10 and android devices, but it didn't like my older XP machine (which might not be the speaker's fault). The strap comes pre attached and is strong, and the build quality is good. I've dropped my on asphalt as well as gravel and also had it in the rain for 6 hours. Battery lasts for 6-8 hours of nonstop phone/music. It does not autopower down after not being used (which is fine with me). I would and have recommended this speaker to friends and other people.",

I have spent countless $$$ on blue tooth shower speakers and water resistant speakers, and they all honestly sucked. They work great if your in a tiny 4 foot area, don't get them fully submerged in the water, or only need them for 2- 3 hours. A few supposed water proof ones crackled within 5 min on the river. . So, I decided to add another one to my collection. I am so glad I did!! This speaker is loud enough coming from the center compartment of a double tube ( with the top closed even)for everyone in the group to hear( and even people floating by) . It was so worth the 5 hours to charge to get over 6+ hours on full volume of music on the river and still have a charge a few days later to listen to music on it! It got wet ( river with rapids.. it's going to happen) and the sound was still crystal clear! You can skip and re play songs with the buttons on the speaker and Answer calls. I would highly recommend this speaker!",

                "review_text": "Wonderful sounds, battery lasts quite awhile before having to recharge, and truly water proof. While I haven't submersed this product in water, in fact I was recommended not to by a friend who has a roommate who owns the same product, but I do moonlight on the weekends washing dishes at a busy restaruant. I actually bought this so I could listen to music to pass the time and because it was waterproof. Since then I have enjoyed many hours of clear and loud music from this beast. During those hours of use it has been sprayed, splashed and even lay in a pool of hot water on top of the dishwasher for far too long till I noticed and placed it somewhere a little less disconcerning. Sometimes it's a little too loud, in the back of a noisy kitchen no less. I love how easy it is to connect to with multple devices, even though the connection chime is a little alarming, I've noticed a few people jump in fright as it lets loose a loud jingle declaring that I have returned to the device. My favorite feature are the navigational buttons, being able to skip tracks or pause and start the music from the device is lovely. Now I keep my phone charging in my room while I get ready in the mornings and take the speaker to the shower. Being able to start the music, adjust the volume and skip songs as I mentioned before has really made the experience of listening to music while getting ready a blast. Eventhough I bought this for wet conditions I use it while reading to get a louder and nicer sound quality. I do advise not to plug headphones in, I tried it out because my phone was charging across the room and the speaker was next to me in my bed and I wondered if I would use it that way. It freaked out and flashed green, which it does when the battery dies. I simply turned it off and on, reconnected my bluetooth and put the moment behind me.",

I've never taken it in the shower (I actually forgot that was even an option until writing this review) so I can't speak to the hardiness of the waterproof qualities.",

The sound is very good quality, and has loud speaker volume, more than most will need. At the highest sound, the sound quality was still good, no crackle or static sounds. The bass quality is also very good. I've had no problems with temperature (102 degrees f -to- 30 degrees f) Not sure what 'extreme' temperatures are advertised not to use. The waterproofing has worked as advertised. I take it into the shower and listen to music all the time, or have it around the pool in pool parties, not having to worry about soaking wet hands, wet clothes, etc. The battery life is good, I rarely charge mine, but I only use it maybe 3 hours on an average week and charge about once every 3.5 weeks. Also, the Bluetooth pairing was simple and straight forward. All the buttons and controls work perfectly; On/Off, Pause/Play - Answer/Reject Calls, Volume up and Down (Hold Volume up for ~3 seconds skips the song, works for me with pandora and play music on Andriod). For the price of these speakers, I was truly amazed at what I got. I highly recommend this product.",

                "review_text": "Found this little treasure in the Black Friday Deals and so glad I did. The positive reviews are true! This small, egg-like, compact little speaker can fit in the palm of your hand but the sound easily fills up a room. One press and the top rises up to reveal the illuminated speaker within. A voice will announce that the speaker is on and when it's connected via bluetooth. The cable that can physically connect to your device is conveniently attached underneath the speaker. It is short but it's a length that works for the purpose it's meant for. Another simple push will turn off the speaker. My sibling has already purchased their own BLKBOX speakers and I plan to give one as a holiday gift to a friend who's been struggling to find a good speaker. Some pros: Unlike some other bluetooth speakers I've tried in the past, this speaker has a remarkably crisp sound with no whirring sound in the background or during lulls between songs. It is plastic but has a weight to it that gives the impression it can take a few hits and drops without missing a beat. It also has a nice smooth texture and sleek design that I personally like. The volume is pretty good for the size and price. Easily fills a room without making a scene. Picks out the individual instruments and subtle musical undertones well. One con I have noticed is that, because there are no buttons on the speaker for volume since it is all controlled via your device, the level of your device will be the level of the speaker and no more. Now, this is perfect when connected to my iPad because it naturally has a loud sound and high volume. But when connected to a smart-phone, I did notice a drastic change in volume simply because the phone's volume could only go so high. The speaker was still good but definitely not as loud. The speaker I tried previously did have volume buttons so when the phone was as high as it could go, the speaker could still go higher and made the music much louder (though the whirring sound persisted). The music still rang clear and it was definitely louder than the phone, but it is a note to consider. One more thing: the support behind this speaker from the company TheGroupDeal has been outstanding. The minute you I ordered the speaker, I received an email from the company thanking my purchase and ensuring me that any problems would be appropriately dealt with should any arise. When my speaker was delivered, I received another email making sure my delivery came safely and that the product worked as promised. Granted, I can't comment on how good the human support is as I have yet to have any problems, but I do appreciate the care and consideration I was given. I will recommend this speaker to whomever is looking for something that really gives the most bang for the buck.",

My dusty old GE \"boom box\" was my original plan, but when I dragged it out of the attic and plugged it in, it was deader than yesterday's love. So, off to the internet. Turns out there are gazillions of options and prices for I-speakers, so I landed on this little guy ... decent user reviews, and cheap enough to toss it if it failed. It is teeny, only about the size of a lemon ... it came with enough charge in it to operate, and it paired up with the phone easily ... in about 20 seconds, I was jammin' to the oldies. The sound from this little guy is amazing ... I placed it in the center of the house, and was able to hear it in every room, with the phone volume set at about 3/4.

                "review_text": "I bought three Bluetooth speakers hoping ONE would be usable. All three ended up being keepers for different reasons. I bought the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3, the Anker Classic Portable, and the Boombotix REX. Portability: All three are fantastic, no real difference. If you want to nitpick, the Boombotix is the smallest, the Anker is next, and the Cambridge is the largest. But again, none of them are really different. I give an edge to the Boombotix for it's clip, it's more flexible. The clip is super hard to get open though. You aren't clipping it to anything thick. Construction and Ergonomics: All three seem durable and well built. The Anker is clearly the best of the three. It's classy, attractive, and feels substantial. And it doesn't walk itself around too much with vibration. But the On/Off switch is terrible. It's tiny and hard to use, you have to use your fingernail. The other buttons are functional, but not as easy to use as the other two. The Boombotix is sturdy and easy to use, the buttons are a little close together, but they work well. It's walks around a little on a hard table, but not terribly. You will have to watch it though, or it will eventually fall off a table. The Cambridge Angle 3 is sturdy and I love the shape. It works really well being able to either lay it down or stand it up. The function buttons are easy to use. The On/Off button is not great, it's too small and in an obscure location. So much so that they have to put a little sticker pointing to it. The rubber end caps are a mixed blessing. I think they will help protect it, but they get really dirty really fast. They pick up every tiny little bit of dust. I recommend standing it up if you put a lot of volume through it because once the bass starts to thump it will bounce and wiggle it's way all over the place. It's actually kinda funny looking. But standing up the passive radiator on the bottom doesn't propel it all over. Sound: I was actually impressed with all three. None of them are on par with the large Sound Dock or Klipsch type speakers, but they could hardly be expected to compete with those at this size and price.The Cambridge is my favorite because it has more bass than the other two. It's a clear winner in bass response. probably about 10-15% more. And that's important to me. The Anker actually has the best overall sound. It's rich and clean. It's probably the \"best\" speaker of all three. And the Boombotix is clearly the loudest. It really puts out some sound. none of them sound bad at all. I would have been happy with any of the three if I hadn't heard the others. But hearing them side by side the Angle 3 fits what I need best. Connectivity: None were bad, but the Boombotix lost connection first, the Angle 3 and the Anker had no trouble at all at 30ft even through walls (but none liked going through a stone fireplace LOL). None were an issue connecting. They were all easy as pie to pair. The Anker was slowest when powering on and trying to find my phone, but we're talking about less than 10 seconds total time for the slowest. Intangibles: The Boombotix has some features that are really appealing. There's an audio out jack, which you can use to run a second speaker (of any make). So that give you options. Send Bluetooth to the speaker and then it will send it to a second speaker. If you don't have a Bluetooth connection on one of your larger speakers you can send signal to the REX and it will connect to your larger speaker. Options are nice. I chose the Angle 3, it fits my needs best with the best imitation of bass, but the others are good enough that I've decided to keep them and use them too. The Anker is nicest, and the Boombotix is loudest and most versatile. I can't really speak to longevity since I haven't had them very long, but I don't think any of them will die on me. Don't be afraid to buy any of these. Just pick the one that fits best.",

                "review_text": "I am a FedEx driver, and wanted a bluetooth speaker that would let me listen to music and especially audiobooks as I drove around. I purchased the first generation OontZ speaker OontZ Angle Bluetooth Speaker [ORIGIINAL] Ultra Portable Wireless with Built in Mic up to 10 Hour Playtime works with iPhone iPad tablet Samsung and smart phones - Black Grille , and it served my purposes fairly well. It wasn't loud enough for our larger package trucks, but for the smaller ones, it worked fairly well. It was a bit of a strain to hear it, though, at highway speeds. I had a charging issue with the speaker after I had been using it for 8 months; I charged it all night, and the next day, it would run for a little while and go dead. I contacted Cambridge, and a helpful rep named Jennifer cheerfully offered to ship me the new OontZ Angle 3 as a free replacement for my older generation model that was acting up. It arrived two days later, and I've been loving it ever since. Even apart from their willingness to replace my product, the customer service is outstanding. Pros: It is louder. I had mentioned that the previous generation was difficult to hear at highway speeds; not the Angle 3. (FedEx Express drivers, note: this speaker will overcome the engine noise for the old Sprinters, the newer Benzes, and of course, the Nissans and the ancient Ford panel vans. The larger W700 and W900 vehicles are still just too loud for this sort of speaker, IMO). I love the play/pause button on the end of the speaker, which allows me to pause an audiobook without messing with my phone. The manual says that this button doesn't work with all apps, but it does work with the Audible app I use. The styling of the Angle 3 is superior to the earlier generation. The stick-on rubber knobs on the bottom of the earlier generation have been replaced by two inch-and-a-half-long rubber strips set into recesses on the bottom of the speaker. I have both in front of me; a gentle push will move the old generation speaker across the table with some resistance, but the Angle 3 is much more resistant to moving. One of the rubber knobs had come off the old model, and I had to stick it back on; I don't see how that sort of thing would even be possible with the Angle 3. As well, there is a rubber-like covering on both ends, and this makes the speaker less angular and \"sharp\". As with the old speaker, the battery life is truly outstanding. I have been surprised at how long a single charge will last. I'm no expert, but I find the clarity of the sound excellent. It certainly serves my purposes for listening to audiobooks. My single \"con\" for the speaker is that it shuts down (to conserve battery) after fifteen minutes of non-use, if it is not plugged in. Not that it's difficult to turn back on! But I'd prefer an option that lets it remain on indefinitely. But that is a minor detail, and doesn't keep me from rating this a 5-star product.",

                "review_text": "I use this primarily in my small 15 foot boat. I live in south florida. This little speaker puts out big sound for size and price. Even with a 50 HP motor directly behind me I can still hear it over my 4 stroke yamaha engine. On New Years eve we had an outside fire and I used this speaker. Set at 1/2 volume it was plenty loud enough. The sound is crisp and clear at almost all volumes except for full volume. It does get a bit distorted. As far as bass goes it's about what you'd expect for a small speaker. It's not very punchy. My favorite feature is the micro SD card slot. I can load up many of my favorite artists on a 16 GB micro sd card and I don't have to drain my phone using bluetooth. I like to stream Pandora but in the boat there are times I lose the cell signal. The micro SD card solves this issue and actually sounds better than bluetooth.Finally, yesterday after a day on the water i mistakenly left the speaker in my boat while I hosed it down. I absolutely drenched this speaker. It wasn't until this morning that I discovered the still soaking wet speaker in my boat. I shook the water out of it and dried the outside. I then went to work and left it to dry for 6 hours. I didn't turn it on until I got home. I'm pleased to say it still sound great. I would highly recommend this item. If I had killed this item with my \"bath\" I would have purchased another one.",

I normally play it at half volume and can hear it clearly throughout my little 2-bedroom home. The speaker has a pretty design and is solidly built. The voice announcement was annoying; it was a very weird, freaky voice. I contacted customer service and received an attachment with a firmware update to remove it. Milla, the customer service representative, sent very precise instructions, the update was simple to install and worked beautifully. The customer service was outstanding. I sent an email on Thanksgiving Day expecting a reply by Monday. I heard back from them within an hour.

The only thing that made me quirk an eyebrow was the method of touch controlling the volume... I actually had to open up the instruction manual for that! ((Gasp!!)) Just run the finger in a clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion along the blue ring on top to increase or decrease volume, so not the most precise manner, but an interesting admixture of old tech knob and new tech touch. Pairing Name: DOSS Soundbox Paired with iPhone (iOS 7.1+) - Does show Bluetooth Battery Meter on iPhone screen; volume buttons on unit are independent of the iPhone's Master Volume. PERSONAL AUDIO TEST RESULTS: Official Specifications put it at 100Hz to 18KHz, but when I ran a Low Frequency Sweep (10Hz to 200Hz), I actually got very robust bass fidelity starting @ 40Hz. For the High Sweep (22KHz to 8KHz), I heard 15KHz. AUDIO SIGNATURE: I generally found the mid and high ranges treble pushed for crispness, yet the perceptual bass is as beefy and round as I have ever heard from a Bluetooth speaker under $40. Heck, it is far better response than far more expensive Bluetooth speakers. Seriously. The lows aren't overdriven or dominating - the crispy mid-vocals and up make sure they stay in the forefront of the soundstage. This speaker is one of those that should do very well indeed both Outdoors, where the clarity and loud maximum volume will cut through open air, and Indoors where the richness of the lower frequencies will come out and play. Warmly recommended. - Product provided for free or discounted price for consumer-end evaluation and review. In the end, my primary concern is bringing forth points for your own pre-purchasing considerations, be it personally positive or negative.",

                "review_text": "My musical tastes run the gamut from ancient Sumerian folk songs to Norwegian Black Metal and everything in between. So I need speakers that deliver. For a while, I had the built in speakers on my monitor, and their sound was good, if lacking. Still, I didn't see a need to add yet one more plug to my already overtaxed surge suppressor, so I went with \"it'll work\", and it did, right up until it didn't. A few weeks ago those monitor speakers finally went out. I figured I could read lips, but that failed rather quickly when I discovered that most software I use doesn't have lips to read. So I gave in, and started shopping around for speakers. Now, contrary to what you may believe here, I am not made of money, so I had to find speakers that were reasonably priced, while still delivering what they promised. I searched around a few regular PC shops, but they wanted a lot of money for very fancy speakers that I knew I wouldn't use to their full potential. I mean, really, do I need a 7.1 surround while I'm working on a spreadsheet and listening to the Alan Parson's Project in the background? Of course not. So I wanted something simple, inexpensive, but good quality. I don't think that's too much to ask. Apparently, unless I'm willing to take a chance on some cheapies from Walmart that will stop working after a few days, that is too much to ask. So I took to Amazon, because let's face it, this is where most of us end up, at least those of us who live in a tiny town where the Walmart is the only choice available for physical locations. I had found another set of speakers before these, and was tempted to buy them, but they had a power cord and not enough actual wattage for what I wanted. Yeah, I'm not looking for something to knock me backwards every time I get a new email, but I do want it to have some power. So finally I saw these speakers, the AmazonBasics USB powered speakers. I continued past them about half a dozen times before I came back to them and figured they would be worth a shot. I mean, they were powered, but by USB so no more stress on my surge protector. They were also smaller, which meant a smaller footprint, to where I could place them on my desk without fear of knocking them over (I have a small desk). So I purchased them. Got them a few days later, unboxed them, and set them up. It was really easy, as it should be, and I powered them on. I picked some Alan Parsons Project from my Winamp library (hey, I like the Alan Parsons Project, alright?). \"I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\" starts up, and as it continues to build, I begin to get this smile on my face. Then it kicks off, and it just sounds *great*. The audio is crystal clear, the sound is sharp. There's just enough bass to make it feel \"full\". In short, I was impressed. I wasn't expecting a lot from $13 USB powered speakers, but I really was impressed. If you're on a budget and need a reliable pair of quality speakers, these are the speakers you want. Believe me. I wish you could hear them, I really do, but trying to show you how good these speakers are when you're obviously looking for better speakers than what you got just really defeats the purpose. That said, I highly recommend these speakers. They're the best bang for your buck. 5/5 Stars John",

I also find Amazon speakers take smaller desk space as Altec lansing is longer than Amazon speakers. From my personal experience these two are great speakers and bang on every dollar spent in any of these. I prefer Amazon a little bit higher than the Altec for the sound quality and smaller dimension. Although Altec looks much cooler than Amazon basic speaker :P",

They are substantial; the sound is - as far as I can tell - spot on with the right balance of treble and bass. And for a real change, the cables are actually long enough to reach the appropriate plugs! Compared to my 10 watt Altec Lansings, I'd have to give the AmazonBasics 4 stars, but the Altec Lansings are twice as big with a very large footprint (or base print or whatever you call desk space).

                "review_text": "These A100's are compact and sound okay, especially if you apply equalization. See below for the equalization parameters I used. I have a Dell monitor with its accompanying Sound Bar. I used to have relatively high-end computer speakers but at some point I started to value compactness and simplicity over sound quality, hence I got the Sound Bar with the monitor. But eventually my pendulum swung the other way and I decided I wanted better quality, but keep simplicity, and not take up a lot of desktop space. I gave these AmazonBasics A100's a try because they're so inexpensive, I figured even if I didn't like them, I wouldn't mind having spent the very little money on them that they cost. Plus, I figured, they couldn't sound worse than the Sound Bar. I love the fact that I can plug the USB power cable into the back of the monitor, alleviating some cable clutter behind and under my desk. The sound quality slightly exceeds that of the Dell Sound Bar. Both have the nice feature that even when the volume is cranked up, if there is no signal, they don't produce much audible hissing noise. Plenty of cheap speakers audibly hiss when turned up, but not these. My ASUS Xonar DGX sound card (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TMZ1BK/) has an equalizer in the driver, so I decided to measure the frequency response of these A100's and the Dell Sound Bar, then compensate for each. Here's the compensation based on the frequency response I measured for the A100's: Frequency in Hz , Amplification in dB: 30 , +20 60 , +20 120 , 9 250 , +3 500 , -6 1000 , +1 2000 , +4 4000 , -14 8000 , +1 16000 , +10 I applied that amount of amplification per channel using the Asus Xonar DGX Audio Center. The improvement is night-and-day better. (If you really want to dial in the compensation better than the GUI sliders let you, you can manually edit the text in the config file directly. It's here: C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\ASUS\\Xonar DGX Audio Center\\cmicnfp.ini. The units are logarithmic, where 1310720 corresponds to 20 dB, and the bands 0-9 correspond to the frequencies listed above.) I applied the same procedure to the Dell Sound Bar. The main difference is that in the 120 Hz band, the Sound Bar response was also below what I could measure. The upshot is that more of the audible frequencies in the Dell were uncalibratable, compared to the A100. So, even after equalizing both, the A100's sound better than the Dell Sound Bar. As you can infer from the chart above, the A100's do not generate much pressure in the extreme low (<=60 Hz) and high (>= 16 kHz) frequencies. That's what you should expect. It would be extraordinarily difficult for such tiny speakers to generate a lot of bass, and without separate tweeters, I wouldn't expect the extreme high-end to sound very crisp. Obviously this is a lot of effort to go through for $14 speakers. I did it out of curiosity more than dedication to making these speakers work for me. The next step up I would take would be a drastic leap from these: Probably AudioEngine A2+ or Vanatoo Transparent One, which cost literally an order of magnitude more money, and take up significantly more desktop space. Not a fair comparison with the A100's. So this was a fun little exercise before diving into spending real money. In summary, these speakers are worth what they cost, and you can get a heck of a lot more out of them if you apply equalization -- which some sound cards offer.",

While a minor thing, and not even close to the reason I chose the 1280T's, but I wasn't a fan of the green theme of the CR'3. My system is read and black themed, desk is dark brown wood grain, and most else is black. Someone in the forums I mentioned brought up these Edifier 1280T's and I had never heard of them before. They also had relatively few reviews here. The reviews they did have though were good, specifically from the other 2 customers who mention the CR3's as well. Not being real into audio I figured if people vouch for the sound quality of both then I should consider all other factors. The 1280T's are larger (4\" vs 3\") which depending on the space you have could be a plus or minus. For me I had enough room and figured if I could get bigger speakers for the same price I should consider it. Also the 1280T's have the controls on the side which I like, a elegant aesthetic to them that I think would fit in with more than the green of the CR3's, and they include a simple but useful remote. The 1280T's also have AUX RCA which I liked. The CR3's do have the ability to switch Right/Left however. I also like the front cover of the 1280T's. I just got the 1280T's setup and the quality was noticeable as I was taking them out of the box. They have that weight all quality electronics have to them. Everything was packed reasonably well and 0 damage to any items in the box. Got them hooked up in a minute or 2 to my PC and was blown away at the sound quality, even at lower volumes. One of my problems prior with a cheap bullet speaker was that dialog was hard to hear. Not with these the vocals/dialog do not get muddled by the bass or mids. Not being an audiophile the best I can do to describe the sound is to say its much more lifelike than any other speakers I have in my house or have heard when I'm out shopping. It sounds natural, not like I am listening to speakers. I am also hearing instruments and sounds that I did not before in various songs/media. I would 100% recommend these to anyone with the same budget and needs as me. It was also recommended to me that I get a better cable than what comes with the speakers. This is the cable I got and while generally the cable doesnt matter to me the quality of this cable also impressed me. Mediabridge 3.5mm Male to 2-Male RCA Adapter (12 Feet) - Step Down Design - (Part# MPC-35-2XRCA-12 ) I dont think you can go wrong with these. For what its worth Im sure the CR3's are not bad either, they may even be better in some ways, but I am very satisfied with the 1280T's.",

                "review_text": "Edifier speakers... Who the heck are they and why don't more people know about them? Let me start by saying that I purchased these as a hold over until I could justify tube amps and quality passive bookshelf speakers (Okay, I really mean wives approval) but these make me question even going down that road. I was pleasantly surprised by the faithful sound reproduction, I mean I really wasn't expecting such full and rich sound from a $99 pair of speakers. I was so happy with them that I thought to myself that if the smaller R1280T is this good, what does the R1700BT sound like? Short answer... about the same but brighter. Yes it may reproduce lows better at lower volumes but I assure you that at 50-100% power it's hardly a noticeable difference and I prefer the warmer natural tweeter in the R1280T over it's more expensive big brother. I personally will be sending the R1700BT's back because the set I received is having some issues with the power switch. The R1700BT does have bluetooth and that alone can justify the additional cost, but you are also getting a larger amp as well making it a solid purchase. The looks of the R1700BT are modern compared to that of the R1280T being retro in my opinion. The R1700BT Edifier R1700BT Bluetooth Bookshelf Speakers - Active Near-field Studio Monitors - Powered Speakers 2.0 Setup Wooden Enclosure - 66w RMS is a great speaker with bluetooth, more power and a great price. But for me it was not the softer more natural sounding performer that the R1280T is. I did test these on my TV as well... Let me tell you that if you have a sound bar like I do (or should I say did), you have no idea of what you are missing. The money I spent on sound bars looking for the cleanest and easiest way to improve TV sound, I could have that tube amp set up a couple times over. However; it is kind of a pain since your TV remote cannot be programed to control the speakers, but if your TV has variable audio out you are golden! I like them so much I'll be ordering another set of these (R1280T's) for my TV. I took some photos of the two side by side as there is really not much difference in size. The R1700BT was basically the same height and width but with a sloped front that brings the base out a bit further. IMO, unnecessarily extending the depth. Either speaker is a winner in my opinion! Set up: U-turn Orbit Special Turntable w/built-in preamp and these Edifier R1280T Powered speakers... End of set up, and I love it!",

                "review_header": "Takes a minute but they're awesome", 
                "review_text": "Quick pros and cons 1. The cable between the two speakers is ~5ft long. This is great for me I have a 2-monitor set-up and I needed to find a pair with a cable long enough to put them on either side. These do that with room to spare. 2. The sound is clear. It actually took me by surprise. My last pair were a little more bassy so I thought something was off but really it's just better sound reproduction. I do a lot of audio recording (voiceovers for videos, podcasting) and my voice sounds good on these. It also captures reverb very well (damn reverb, need to upgrade my audio set up next!) 3. These sound nice. The highs aren't bad, the mids aren't bad, and the bass isn't bad. I mean they're not like amazing great but these are also $25 speakers. This is probably the best noise I've ever gotten out of $25 speakers. 4. My last pair of speakers were USB powered and I grew to hate that. These are AC powered (6ft long power cable) and that makes me happy. 5. The volume has a good, high quality feel to it. 6. The speakers are deceptively light and made of plastic, but they look really nice with my whole set up. 7. The 2.5\" drivers per speaker definitely do their job. Also, these speakers can get pretty loud before getting all nasty sounding. Not like rattle-the-windows loud, but definitely louder than you'll need them to be. Cons 1. The tone knob is rubbish. Put it in the center and use your computer's system equalizer if you need to mess with it. 2. These things are huge! Easily the size of my forearm. I wasn't expecting them to be that large. It ended up not being a problem (hence no stars removed). 3. Read other thoughts Other Thoughts These things take a bit to \"burn in\". I had them shipped and it's winter time so they may have just been cold but the first couple of hours I spent tweaking every setting on my computer trying to figure out why everything sounded so muted. The bass sounded fine, but the mids and highs sounded a tad muffled (like the sound you get when you put your hand over a speaker. I turned the music off, reset everything to default (where I had started from) and let them chill for a few hours. Then, while I was out, I put them up on moderate volume and, without messing with any equalizers, put some music on and left them playing for 5 or so hours. Once they warmed up and got a little burn in, they sounded much better. For most cases I use default on all the system noises but in Winamp I chose a preset that boosts the bass and treble a little bit. Even when burnt in, the lows and bass need a little boosting to keep up with the mids. Now I'm quite happy with how everything sounds. They require a little work, but once you get them settled in these are a fantastic pair of speakers and probably among the best you can get until you start getting into 2.1 speakers. *****Update August 1st, 2014***** I bought a second pair of these speakers. My girlfriend's speakers died and I gave her the original ones I bought (still going strong after 7 months) and I bought myself another pair. This time it was shipped during the summer so the speakers weren't submitted to the harsh, frigid cold of winter time like the first pair. Thanks to this, the problems I experienced the first time around were much less pronounced and much easier to fix. The \"burn-in\" wasn't really required at all and once I got the volume and such configured everything worked pretty well. It took me about a day with the first pair but this time around it only took a couple of hours of use before they sounded good. I guess that means most of the problems were simply because they were cold when I first plugged them in. It keeps its 5 star rating. I have bought two of these and would buy a third. I'll update if either of these break down but until then, I'm still happy with my purchase. Still gets my vote on the best $25 speakers around. I'd say I'd buy them again but I just kind of did so yeah I'd probably buy them a third time. *****Update May 6th, 2015***** Happened to be goofing around notice that this was the highest rated review. Cool! So I thought I'd do an update. Both sets of these speakers still work flawlessly (my girlfriend's pair that I gave her and my current pair). They both still sound great. If these broke, I would still buy these over again (unless, of course, I had like some serious cash to spend on a serious set of speakers). I still do my audio recordings, albeit on much better hardware than before. My recordings still sound great on these. I've had no problems with them whatsoever. They survived moving without breaking and a fried motherboard without flinching. I still recommend these to people :) *****Update December 18th, 2016***** Still the best ~$25 speakers out there. Both pairs still work after years of use. These days I have to keep the sound down as my roommate works night shift so these actually didn't get used for about 10 months (been using headphones). Turned em on and cranked em up a bit and it's the same old speakers I remember. Again, I proclaim, that unless I'm spending serious money on serious speakers, these are still my cheap go-to speakers. So happy they still sell these.",

I also chose this speaker for it's good looks, and planned to mount it next to the monitors on my dual display to clear the desktop. This worked out great--please see the photos. I used a piece of aluminum angle bolted to the monitor mounts and screwed into the back of the speakers. I considered adding another bracket at the bottom, but the speakers hang nicely from the top bracket. I will probably paint the angle black but left it unpainted for the photo. NOTE: You can remove the stands as I did by opening the case and removing 4 small screws inside holding the stands in place. To open the case you just need to back out 8 screws on the back of the speaker box. You also have to pull the volume knob on the right speaker and use a socket or needle nose pliers to remove the retaining bolt and washer. The speaker stands really should be easily removable but I didn't think it was worth knocking off a star.",

I think my usb wifi adapter or something is causing interference. Anyway, when they are plugged into the front of my computer, they are flawless. They play clearly and loudly and they are completely silent when I have nothing playing on my computer. Hurray for no humming! P.S. The speakers are much bigger than I expected. My dinky $7 speakers were half the size so these things look like big hulking bricks to me! But at least they are high quality! If you took two ordinary red bricks and stood them up on your desk, that's a pretty good estimation of the height and thickness of these speakers.",

There is a \"tone\" dial that seems like a decoration. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch but the sound quality just won't cut it for extended listening. Maybe if you've never had speakers before these would be a worthwhile starter set, but honestly i can't understand where all the glowing reviews came from. I expected too much and now a $20 Prime purchase would cost me half the price to return them, so they will sit here in a closet collecting dust. The design is great, they would look awesome on any desk. I wish they could use the same profile, and put some better quality speakers into them. Learn from me, if you are a fan of audio, spend double at least get something with a small subwoofer and skip right over these.",

The LEDs are nice and bright not to mention the feature to change how they light up or to turn them off completely. If you don't want to use Bluetooth you can plug it in via the Auxiliary port and it has a built in microphone. It lasts for an incredible amount of time in between charge cycles.

I haven't had time yet to review its battery life, or the function of those cute lights, but so far it brings a smile to our faces just watching the light pattern it came out of the box with. Nice, sturdy box too. The female voice that helps by giving pointers is a nice touch. The volume control was not easy to understand but I've not taken much time yet: I just controlled volume at my iPad so far, and for the price, that's fine, but I assume I'll learn more soon. The distance range is from one end of our modest size home to the other. Nice!

Loud enough to be a music source while playing pick up basketball in a gym and it was the main source of music at a 20-25 person get together in a basement. This speaker has some power. Loudness probably gets a rating of 3.5/5. And the option to toggle the bass and treble is awesome too to get the clearest sounding music. Now to the bad parts. the bluetooth kept disconnecting even though the phone was resting on top of it, and when switching to the aux it would do a weird red and blue blinking thing and not produce any music at the most random times. You can imagine how annoying this would be especially when playing music in front of a number of people with everyone jamming out. Maybe I'm just heavy handed but about a week and a half of moderate use, the charging plug in broke and now I can't get it to charge. The battery lasts forever but once it dies I wont be able to charge it at all and it will be a useless block. Very disappointed in this speaker because I feel like it has so much potential to be a top selling affordable speaker. I think i will purchase one more to see if mine was just a dud but come on Sylvania!! If this thing worked properly i'd rate it 4.5/5 but it needs some hardware work.",

Seems nice, sounds good, and is rechargeable. Kinda is a bummer that there's no remote control with it, but it's bluetooth, so you can adjust right from the phone. The only thing I dislike is the annoying LED that shines on the speakers cannot be turned off. I would think the battery would last longer if you could. Also it's really lightweight, so I question its durability and longevity. It sits atop a tool box, so I'm hoping for the best",

I really need the one that's a dc5 USB cord with the other plug to it so it's plugged in and charged other than that I love this speaker just don't know how to get in touch with anybody to tell them that they messed up on the charging plug",
